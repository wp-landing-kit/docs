## Introduction

[WP Landing Kit](https://wplandingkit.com/) provides a simple PHP API to enable developers to programmatically work with domains. The API makes it
possible to:

1. Add new domain entries to the database.
1. Edit existing domain entries.
1. Delete domain entries.

When creating or editing a domain, the API provides control over:

1. Domain URL mappings (you can think of these as routes/endpoints)
    - Mappings can resolve to posts/pages/archives
    - Mappings can also redirect to both relative and absolute URLs
1. Domain settings
    - Protocol enforcement
    - Active status
    - Domain ownership (which WordPress user is the 'author' of the domain)

### Important!

It is important to keep in mind that the API affects the database and should not be used as part of a typical WordPress
page load. Instead, it is designed to be used at strategic points as a means of automating domain creation/manipulation.
e.g; You may choose to run this after a WooCommerce/Easy Digital Downloads transaction or perhaps after user
registration, etc.

## Usage

TODO - once we have all the examples in, let's break it all down a little more so if flows better and builds knowledge
instead of throwing out big snippets.

### Inserting a new domain into the database

You may create new domains using the `wplk_add_domain()` function. The function will return a `WPLK_Domain` object on
success or a `WP_Error` object when the domain is already in the database or some other failure occurs. Newly created
domains are inactive by default â€” that is, they are in a `draft` status and are not actively handling requests made to
the site. See _[Activating a domain](#activating-a-domain)_.

```php
// Create an inactive domain with no mappings.
$domain = wplk_add_domain( 'mydomain.com' );

// Create an inactive domain with the domain root mapped to a post.
$post_id = 1234;
$domain = wplk_add_domain( 'mydomain.com', $post_id );

// Create an active domain with the domain root mapped to a post.
$post_id = 1234;
$domain = wplk_add_domain( 'mydomain.com', $post_id, true );

// Create an active domain with an owner (user ID), an enforced protocol, and with the root mapped to a post.
$post_id = 1234;
$user_id = 5678;
$domain = wplk_add_domain( 'mydomain.com', [
    'post_id' => $post_id,
    'owner_id' => $user_id,
    'active' => true,
    'enforced_protocol' => 'https',
] );
```

### Getting an existing domain

You may get an existing domain using the `wplk_get_domain()` function. The function will return a `WPLK_Domain` object
if the domain is found otherwise it will return `NULL`. You can pass this function one of the following:

1. The domain post ID.
1. The domain host name. e.g; `mydomain.com`.
1. A full URL containing the domain host name. e.g; `http://mydomain.com/some/path`.
    - In this case, the host name will be extracted from the URL. All other elements of the URL will be ignored.

**Note:** The most efficient lookup is achieved using the post ID so use that if/when possible.

```php
// Lookup using the domain post ID.
$domain = wplk_get_domain( 5 );

// Lookup using the domain host name:
$domain = wplk_get_domain( 'mydomain.com' );

// Lookup using a full URL containing the domain host name:
$domain = wplk_get_domain( 'http://mydomain.com/some/path' );
```

<!-- ## Functions -->

<!-- | Function | Use | -->

<!-- ## Objects -->

<!-- There are a few underlying objects used by the API functions which you may use if you prefer to work with objects. These -->
<!-- are included in the API and are safe to use as per these documented examples: -->

<!-- - [WPLK_Domain](objects/wplk_domain.md) object -->
<!-- - [WPLK_Mapping](objects/wplk_mapping.md) object -->
